## One-Sentence Elevator Pitch

A real-time **1v1 summoning battler** where every card is single-use, every hero is unique, and every match feels like commanding your own army of magic.

## Core Fantasy

You are a **wizard-commander**, leading a living army of summons and spells. Each match is a duel of wits and will — limited resources, shifting odds, and one decisive ultimate.

You win not by outspending, but by **out-summoning**: using timing, positioning, and courage to turn your finite deck into victory.

## Design Pillars

### 1. Real-Time Strategy on One Screen

- 3-5-minute duels on a fixed horizontal battlefield
- Pannable camera with boundary constraints
- Pure tactical tension

### 2. Every Card Counts

- Single-use cards — every deployment matters
- Decks up to 30 cards, creating pacing from skirmish to all-out war

### 3. Asymmetric Heroes & Fate

- Collectable summoners with unique mana curves, affinities, and growth potential
- First hero chosen by *fate* to create a unique player journey

### 4. Meaningful Risk, Earned Reward

- Optional wagers with emotional stakes
- Power variance matters long-term but never decides early matches

### 5. Collection Pride & Personal Growth

- Rarity equals *potential*, not instant power
- Even common heroes can become legends

## Unique Selling Points

- **Single-use deck system** — Deep tactical decisions unlike any other mobile battler
- **Summoner heroes as resource engines** — Bases with personality and strategic identity
- **Optional wagers** — Emotional stakes without gambling
- **Randomized fated origins** — Every player's story begins uniquely
- **Fast, pannable RTS feel** — Real-time readability built for mobile and desktop

## Tone & Emotion

Competitive yet **mythic** — *Clash Royale meets Hades*.

High-contrast fantasy with distinct elemental identities. Serious, mystical, and proud.

## High-Level Structure

- **Core Loop:** Collect → Build → Battle → Reward → Evolve
- **Session Length:** 3-5 minutes
- **Monetization:** Cosmetics and hero unlocks (no pay-to-win)
- **Platform:** Mobile-first, expandable to PC
- **Engine:** Godot 4.5

## Vision Summary

**Project Summoner** is a competitive, emotionally charged dueling game where individuality is built into the rules.

Every match is different. Every army is unique. Every victory is personal.
